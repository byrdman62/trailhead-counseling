# Trailhead Counseling

## About

This project is the codebase for trailheadcounseling.com and is hosted by GitHub Pages

## Development

To test, run this. (Using the `--trace` flag for verbose errors.)

```sh
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --trace
```

Then open your browser at:

- http://localhost:4000

Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test the theme's contents. As you make modifications, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh.
